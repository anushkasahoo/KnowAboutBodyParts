        <h1>The Respiratory System</h1>
            <p>The respiratory system includes the organs used for the process of respiration. It involves the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. It supplies oxygen to various parts of the body. The respiratory system includes nose, windpipe and lungs. Respiration is the movement of oxygen into the body and carbon dioxide is given out of the body.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>In the process, we breathe in through the nose. This air goes to the lungs through the windpipe. Nose first clears the air taken in. Then tranfers it to the windpipe. Windpipe is divided into two parts. Each part of the windpipe attaches to each of the lungs. In the lungs, exchange of gases takes place. The oxygen we breathe in, burns the food we eat and releases energy.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Each of our lungs contains about 300 million balloon-like structures called Alveoli.</p>
