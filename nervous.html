        <h1>The Nervous System</h1>
            <p>The nervous system controls the nerves and provides body's response to different types of stimuli. It is a network of nerve cells and fibres which transmit messages among various  parts of th body. The main organs are brain, nerves and spinal cord.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Brain</h3>
            <p>The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system, and with the spinal cord makes up the central nervous system. The brain consists of the cerebrum, the brainstem and the cerebellum. It controls most of the activities of the body, processing, integrating, and coordinating the information it receives from the sense organs, and making decisions as to the instructions sent to the rest of the body. The brain is contained in, and protected by, the skull bones of the head.</p>
            <h3>Nerves</h3>
            <p>A nerve is a cable-like structure within the body designed to conduct nerve impulses that relay information from one part of the body to another. A typical nerve is made up of a bundle of fibres which are wrapped around layers of tissue and fat, and they stretch throughout the body. These nerves transmit information along the axons to the respective organs. These are the basic elements that constitute a nerve. Nerves are a part of the nervous system. They are primarily involved in control and the coordination of all the parts of the body.The nervous system not only sends and receives messages but also processes them into chemical signals called impulses in the human body. A wide network of nerves is spread throughout our body, which also runs through the brain, the spinal cord and many organs.</p>
            <h3>Spinal Cord</h3>
            <p>The spinal cord is a long bundle of nerves and cells that extends from the lower portion of the brain to the lower back. It carries signals between the brain and the rest of the body.</p>
